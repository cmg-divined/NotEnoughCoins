# Contributing to NotEnoughCoins

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NotEnoughCoins. As an open source project worked on in my spare time, all
help is appreciated. To have your pull requests accepted, please follow the rules below:

**1. No multi-line comments**\
All comments should be short and simple, explaining what a code block does. This should be short enough to finish on one
line. The only kind of 'multi-line' comments in this project should be Javadoc comments.

**2. No random features**\
NotEnoughCoins is an **auction flipping mod**. Please bare this in mind when if you wish to add a new feature. If you
want some good ideas, there is plenty that have been accepted in
our [Discord server](https://notenoughcoins.net/discord).

**3. Test your code**\
Please make sure your code works. I don't want extra stress from 100 support tickets being opened after I merge your
commits.

**4. No 'QOL' features**\
The version of NotEnoughCoins in this repository will never have features added that may be considered against Hypixel's
rules.

Good luck!\
-Adam (mindlesslydev)
